Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the branch of computer science used for designing, developing,testing and maintaining software.
The importance of software engineering:
1. Reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias.
2. Efficiency- it helps optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
3. Scalability and flexibility- it ensures the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Structured programming- introduced modular design to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.
2. Object-oriented programming- brought concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance and polymorphism.
3. Agile methodology- emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability, replacing rigid, linear approaches.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements Gathering- involves understanding and documenting what the software needs to do.
2.Design- involves creating blueprints for the software, including architecture and user interfaces.
3.Coding- involves writing the actual code based on the design.
4.Testing- involves verifying that the software works as intended and fixing bugs.
5.Deployment- involves releasing the software to users.
6.Maintenance- involves updating and improving the software post-release.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1.Waterfall: A linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements. It has low flexibility and testing is dome at the end of the developmental phase. An example is like building a bridge.

2.Agile: An iterative approach that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration. Suitable for projects with evolving requirements like developing a mobile app. Regular customer feedback is incorporated at every sprint.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer- Writes code, debugs, and implements features.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer- Tests the software to ensure it meets quality standards.
3. Project Manager- Oversees the project, manages timelines, and coordinates team efforts.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated development environments- Provide an integrated environment for coding, debugging, and testing, improving productivity. Examples include visual studio code and Java.
2. Version control systems-track changes to code, enabling collaboration and version management.Example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Changing Requirements- Use Agile methodologies to adapt to changes.
2.Technical Debt- Regularly refactor code to maintain quality.
3.Team Collaboration- Use tools like Slack and Jira for effective communication

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing- Tests individual components or functions.
2. Integration Testing- Ensures different modules work together.
3. System Testing- Validates the entire system against requirements.
4. Acceptance Testing- Confirms the software meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs to AI models to elicit desired outputs. It is crucial for interacting effectively with AI systems and ensuring accurate and relevant responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
1. Vague prompt- Tell me about history
2. Improved prompt- Explain to me how Kenya gained independence in the 1960s.

The improved one is more effective because it is clear, specific and curious.
